# Guitarras - Vue from scratch

"Sometimes, the best way forward is to return to the basics. Simplicity brings clarity, and from clarity comes strength."

This project is a foundational Vue 3 application built to revisit and solidify core Vue.js concepts. After working some time as a TL I want to revamp on the basics of component structure, data binding, directives, event handling, and Vue Router integration. The goal is to regain a deep understanding of Vue 3's reactivity system, composition API, and other essential features introduced in the latest version.
